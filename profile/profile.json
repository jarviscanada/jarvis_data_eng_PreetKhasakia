        "Grep App: Implemented a java application that mimics the Linux 'grep' command to search and retrieve matching strings from files. Technologies used for this project are Maven, Java, Docker as a deployment tool and IntelliJ IDE. Implementation of backend code uses Encapsulation along with an interface to provide a flexible and organized implementation of the application. Deployment is done by dockerizing the app which includes building an image locally, running the docker container and push the image onto Docker Hub for verification of the image.",
        "JDBC App: The JDBC application establishes a connection between the java Customer program to an RDBMS. The basic flow of the JDBC app follows a simple process of mounting the driver and creating a connection. From that connection comes executing SQL statements, and then commit/rollback and finally close the connection. The application consists of multiple java classes each with its own function of providing the methods and connections that allow the user to access database elements with SQL queries pre-defined within the Customer DAO class."

Throughout my years in undergrad, I was exposed to many different assignments and projects that allowed to gain knowledge in various aspects of programming essentials. Coursework in distributed systems, cloud computing and Capstone I/II had a great deal of hands-on experience with the ability to grow in a team-oriented work environment. I have recently joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer trainee to improve on my skillset and familiarize myself with real-world projects to continue to grow and apply knowledge throughout the program."
