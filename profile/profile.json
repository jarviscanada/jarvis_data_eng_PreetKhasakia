        "Grep App: Created a java application that mimics the Linux 'grep' command to search and retrieve matching strings from a given file. Technologies used for this project are Maven, Java, Docker and IntelliJ IDE. Implementation of the backend uses Encapsulation and an interface to provide a flexible, organised implementation of the program. Deployment is done by dockerizing the app which includes building an image locally, running the docker container and pushing the it to Docker Hub to verify the image.",
        "JDBC App: The JDBC API establishes a connection between the java Customer program to a PostgreSQL database instance. The basic flow of the JDBC app follows a simple process of mounting the driver, followed by creating a connection to the database, executing SQL statements, commit/rollback and finally closing the connection. The application consists of multiple java classes, each with its own function that allows the user to access database elements with pre-defined SQL queries within the Customer DAO class."

Throughout my years in undergrad I worked on various projects, both team-oritented and individual, in several engineering courses where I gained knowledge in different programming languages such as Java, C, Web programming and Python with the addition of excelling in research, problem solving and contributing with team members. Coursework in distributed systems, cloud computing and Capstone I/II had a great deal of hands-on experience with the ability to grow in a team-oriented work environment. I have joined Jarvis Consulting Group as a Software Engineer trainee that enables me to improve my skillset, as well as familiarize with real-world projects, and continue to progress throughout the program."
