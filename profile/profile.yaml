# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate out of Ontario Tech University in Software Engineering. Throughout my years in undergrad, I was exposed to many different assignments and projects that allowed to gain knowledge in various aspects of programming essentials. Coursework in distributed systems, cloud computing and Capstone I/II had a great deal of hands-on experience with the ability to grow in a team-oriented work environment. I have recently joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer trainee to improve on my skillset and familiarize myself with real-world projects to continue to grow and apply knowledge throughout the program.
