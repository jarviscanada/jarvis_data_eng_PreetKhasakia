# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate out of Ontario Tech University in Bachelors of Engineering, Software. Throughout my years in undergrad I worked on various projects, both team-oritented and individual, in several engineering courses where I gained knowledge in different programming languages such as Java, C, Web programming and Python with the addition of excelling in research, problem solving and contributing with team members. Coursework in distributed systems, cloud computing and Capstone I/II had a great deal of hands-on experience with the ability to grow in a team-oriented work environment. I have joined Jarvis Consulting Group as a Software Engineer trainee that enables me to improve my skillset, as well as familiarize with real-world projects, and continue to progress throughout the program.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    
    description: "Designed and implemented a linux cluster agent to preserve and monitor real-time data of nodes running on CentOS. Application performs real-time data collection of hardware specifications and CPU memory usage. Created a Data Definition Language (DDL) script to hold specified data into tables used in the database. Modified 'host_info.sh' and 'host_usage.sh' to retrieve the necessary and insert it to the database."

  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description: 
        - "Grep App: Created a java application that mimics the Linux 'grep' command to search and retrieve matching strings from a given file. Technologies used for this project are Maven, Java, Docker and IntelliJ IDE. Implementation of the backend uses Encapsulation and an interface to provide a flexible, organised implementation of the program. Deployment is done by dockerizing the app which includes building an image locally, running the docker container and pushing the it to Docker Hub to verify the image." 
        - "JDBC App: The JDBC API establishes a connection between the java Customer program to a PostgreSQL database instance. The basic flow of the JDBC app follows a simple process of mounting the driver, followed by creating a connection to the database, executing SQL statements, commit/rollback and finally closing the connection. The application consists of multiple java classes, each with its own function that allows the user to access database elements with pre-defined SQL queries within the Customer DAO class."
